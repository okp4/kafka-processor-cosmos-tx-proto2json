## Purpose

A Kafka Streams Processor that consumes CÃ˜SMOS protobuf messages from an `input` Kafka topic and sends a [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
decoded message in the `output` topic.

## Implementation

Implementation mainly relies on [Kafka Streams API](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams), library to create
event-stream applications with the following features:

- no external dependency other than Kafka itself,
- simple and light library,
- fault-tolerant and scalable.

Moreover, this implementation:

- uses [Kotkin](https://kotlinlang.org/) as primary coding language,
- is as much as possible, lean, i.e. tries to minimize the dependencies to 3rd party libraries and the resulting package
  footprint.

## Build

This project targets the [JVM 11+](https://openjdk.java.net/), so be sure to have it available in your environment.

This project relies on the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build system.

If you are on windows then open a command line, go into the root directory and run:

```sh
.\gradlew build
```

If you are on linux/mac then open a terminal, go into the root directory and run:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

This command line produces 2 JAR files:

- a _regular_ JAR: `kafka-processor-cosmos-tx-proto2json-X.Y.jar`
- a _fat_ JAR: `kafka-processor-cosmos-tx-proto2json-X.Y-standalone.jar`

This last one is the one to use as it contains all the dependencies in it.
